# Simple Borderless Displays
Unlike a traditional display, there are no borders. Imagine you're normal one, remove it's borders. I know this is difficult to picture, but it makes for better pictures. Take a picture, add a border, it's probably worse. Take that worsened picture, remove the border, I bet it's better, probably.
